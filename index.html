        Hi Everyone,
        <br />
        I want to provide some additional guidance for your assignment 3 submission. In the 
        development meetings we'll discuss the specifics of your UI, but given the due date's 
        proximity to the week 12 class, I thought it might be worth writing about the other aspect 
        of the assignment in a way you can refer back to.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, make sure you go through the assessment brief to ensure you have an 
        understanding of what is required, but here I'll provide some additional tips.
      </p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This assignment is a chance to not only show off your final UI, but to reflect on the 
        process of its production. This involves a written component (supported by other types of 
        information) where you'll need to cover 6 different points. As the assessment criteria 
        notes, this should be a detailed discussion (telling me what you did) and a meaningful 
        reflection (was that thing successful? what did I learn from it?).
      </p>
      <p>
        Self-reflection and self-criticality are important skills as a designer in any medium, 
        and the written reflection is not only a chance to highlight the things you did well, 
        but to look at the parts that you think could have been approached in a different manner. 
        When I assess reflections, I value an honest discussion of the process, and am looking for 
        an engagement with your own perspective of what occurred as you were building your UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        While there's no word limit or suggestion on the written component, there are 6 different 
        points you are required to highlight. They are a separated list, and I'll briefly touch on 
        each below, however your reflection doesn't need to be formatted as a paragraph on each. 
        While it may be good to use the keywords (values, feedback, learnability etc) to signal 
        their discussion in your writing, these different points should relate to each other, your 
        UIs concept, and the way it responds to the creative prompt and advanced technique. As 
        such integrating them together within the structure of your reflection will typically make 
        sense.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <li>Your design's guiding values and how they were embodied in the UI.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We looked at design values back in week 5, discussing some common values that get deployed 
        in Interaction Design. Here I'm looking for you to speak to a couple of values (2 or 3 is 
        fine) and how they practically influenced your design. So if you were to discuss immersion, 
        going beyond stating that your UI was intended to be immersive, and connecting it to the 
        specific aspects of your UI's appearance and behaviour that are intended to create 
        immersion. You can reference the values we discussed in week 5, but you can also instead 
        speak to your own set of values, as long as you're making the connection between them and 
        your UI's design.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your rationale in designing your UI's feedback, information design, mapping and learnability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tying back to what we covered at the start of semester, you should discuss and reflect upon 
        how each of these concepts are deployed within your design. This doesn't mean covering each 
        single aspect of information design, for example, in your UI, but highlighting one or two 
        specific cases as a manner of discussing a broader approach. This approach might directly 
        connect to your values, or to other of the core concepts, or even technical and production 
        restrictions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any significant changes since your work in progress milestone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You need to reflect upon any changes since the prototype and concept presentation (which 
        you did as your progress milestone), speaking to not only what changed, but why it changed, 
        and perhaps if that change was successful.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your navigation of the production timeline and how you spent your development time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You need to address the process of producing your UI along with its final outcome. This 
        could involve a specific timeline, particular moments of inflection, or speaking to areas 
        where you spent more/less time than you thought you would. In reflecting on this you might 
        for example look at your plans versus what happened, where those things aligned, where they 
        diverged, and what this taught you about scoping and delivering self directed projects.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The design aspect that you are most proud of.</li>
        <li>The design aspect you found most challenging.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The final two are different sides of the same coin. I've specifically avoided using 
        positive/negative wording, and focused on your perspective, versus what you think others 
        might perceive in your final UI. Maybe you're most proud of an underlying JS function that 
        no user will ever see, or you found making your characterisation cohesive the most 
        challenging, even if you think it was ultimately successful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember that this will be a document of your project, so try to write and answer these 
        topics in a way that communicates in detail your intentions and how they were put into 
        practice.

      <h3>Submission Format</h3>
      <p>
        Like the previous two assignments this submission will be a small web page - this should be 
        separate to your UI, and contain the required written reflection and links. Use this format 
        to your advantage - you don't have to make it complex, but remember you are able to use 
        embedded links, images and videos as part of communicating your reflection. This includes the 
        required links - for example you need to reflect on significant changes between your 
        <a href="https://lustrous-hamster-391a07.netlify.app/" target="_blank">
          prototype
        </a>
        and 
        <a href="https://lustrous-hamster-391a07.netlify.app/" target="_blank">
          finished UI
        </a>
        , and you are able to point to them directly to support your discussion. Or you 
        could link to a specific code file in your repo with a line reference, as a way to support your 
        rationale for designing the UI's mapping.
